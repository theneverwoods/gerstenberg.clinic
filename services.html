                <p>Most labs can be taken care of right here in our office. We provide a mini-draw station inside our office during normal business hours that we can send to LabCorp or Quest. We cannot draw labs that are ordered by a physician outside of our office.</p>

                <p>We are able to perform digital X-rays done by Registered Radiology Technicians. Performing x-rays in our office assists our physicians to determine the cause of a problem you are experiencing without having to wait for x-rays to be done at an outside radiology clinic. If needed, we are able to have a radiologist read the x-rays also. </p>
                <p>Diagnostic echocardiograms and ultrasounds are offered on specific days in our office. Results from these tests usually take 1 week to receive since a radiologist must read them.</p>

                <h2 class="center no-m-t">ANS Testing</h2>
                <p>Autonomic Function Testing Laboratory offers comprehensive surveillance of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). This part of the nervous system controls and regulates the automatic functions within our body including regulation of blood pressure, heart rate, airway size and airflow to the lungs, digestive tract functions, sweat production, bladder control and sexual function. In the course of certain neurological disorders including neuropathies, particularly diabetic neuropathy, the ANS can be damaged and become dysfunctional.</p>
                <p>A simple test done in the exam room will help determine your risk of nerve-related disorders that would require more intensive management of underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease or neurologic problems. Supplements, proper fluid use and/or medications can dramatically influence a person's autonomic function.</p>
                <p>"Autonomic testing to determine autonomic dysfunction is a standard of care" for detecting both clinical and sub-clinical cardiovascular disease and is recognized by the American Heart Association. (AHA Scientific statement: Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease, a statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association. Circulation. 1999; 100: 1134-1146. p. 1138)</p>

                <p>The ankle-brachial index (ABI) test is a quick way to check your risk for peripheral artery disease (PAD). Peripheral artery disease is a condition in which the arteries in your legs or arms are narrowed or blocked. People with peripheral artery disease are at a much greater risk of heart attack, stroke, poor circulation and leg pain.</p>

                <h2 class="center no-m-t">Nerve Conduction Studies</h2>
                <p>A nerve conduction study is a completely painless test that measures how well individual nerves can send an electrical signal from the spinal cord to the muscles. Nerve conduction studies are often used to help diagnose nerve disorders, such as carpal tunnel syndrome or Guillain-Barr syndrome. During a nerve conduction test, a health professional places a sensor directly over the muscle and the nerve to be studied and records the level at which a patient perceives the impulse. Diagnostic uses for nerve conduction studies also includes identifying abnormal sensations, such as numbness, tingling, or pain in an extremity like in peripheral neuropathy (the most common use of this test).</p>

                <h2 class="center no-m-t">ECG (Electrocardiogram)</h2>
                <p>An electrocardiogram is a test that checks for problems with the electrical activity of your heart. An ECG translates the heart's electrical activity into line tracings on paper; this is then interpreted by your physician. During an ECG you will lie on an exam table, several electrodes will be attached to the skin, you will then be asked to lie very still and breathe normally during the test. The test takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.</p>

                <h2 class="center no-m-t">Holter Monitor</h2>
                <p>A Holter monitor is a small, wearable device that records your heart rhythm. You usually wear a Holter monitor for one to three days. During that time, the device will record all of your heartbeats. A Holter monitor test is usually performed after a traditional test to check your heart rhythm (electrocardiogram) isn't able to give your doctor enough information about your heart's condition. A Holter monitor has electrodes that are attached to your chest with adhesive and then are connected to a recording device. Your doctor uses information captured on the Holter monitor's recording device to figure out if you have a heart rhythm problem. While wearing a Holter monitor may be a little inconvenient, it's an important test that may help your doctor diagnose your condition.</p>

              <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="oximetry">
                <h2 class="center no-m-t">Oximetry</h2>
                <p>Oximetry is a non-invasive procedure for measuring the concentration of oxygen in the blood. The testing is done by using a reusable probe placed on the finger that indirectly monitors the oxygen saturation of the patient's blood.</p>

                <h2 class="center no-m-t">PFT (Pulmonary Function Tests)</h2>
                <p>Pulmonary function tests are a group of tests that measure how well the lungs take in and release air and how well they move gases such as oxygen from the atmosphere into the body's circulation. In a spirometry test, while you are sitting, you breathe into a mouthpiece that is connected to an instrument called a spirometer. The spirometer records the amount and the rate of air that you breathe in and out over a period of time. For some of the test measurements, you can breathe normally and quietly. Other tests require forced inhalation or exhalation after a deep breath. Sometimes you will be asked to inhale the substance or a medicine to see how it changes your test results. Since the test involves some forced breathing and rapid breathing, you may have some temporary shortness of breath or lightheadedness.</p>
