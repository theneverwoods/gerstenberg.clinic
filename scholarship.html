		<h3>Ozone UBI</h3>
        <p>Ozone (O3) is added into your own 60 mL of blood and reinfused with the aid of ultraviolet light to promote optimal oxygenation, reduce inflammation, and modulate the immune response.</p>

		<h3>NAD+</h3>
        <p>NAD+ (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) occurs naturally in the body, and plays a major role in maximizing energy at the mitochondrial level, where micronutrients are converted to energy-rich ATP molecules to enable cellular function. NAD promotes fat metabolism and may help manage a wide spectrum of diseases, ranging from diabetes to cancer. It is neuro-regenerative & anti-aging.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 30px">Frequently Asked Questions:</h2>
        
		<h3 style="margin-bottom: -30px">How much does an IV infusion cost?</h3>
		<p>Because this is vitamins and nutrients, not medication, don't expect insurance to pay for treatment.</p>
        <p>See our <a href="/pdf/ivmenu.pdf" target="_blank">full menu</a> for pricing.</p>
        
        <h3 style="margin-bottom: -30px;margin-top: 20px">Does it hurt?</h3>
		<p> Just like getting your blood drawn, there will be a small stick. But once the IV is flowing, the needle is removed, and you just have a small piece of plastic as a conduit to your vein.
		</p>
        <p>You may be slightly cold, so come mentally prepared for that.</p>
        
        <h3 style="margin-bottom: -30px">How quickly will I see results?</h3>
		<p>It depends - on you and the treatment you receive. People coming in to treat inflammation or illness often feel better immediately. But for chronic issues, repeated treatments are recommended before expecting to see results.
        </p>
        
        <h3 style="margin-bottom: -30px">Who can receive IV infusions?</h3>
		<p>Almost anyone. You will need to consult with a provider beforehand to determine the best treatment option for you.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-bottom: -30px">Can I take other supplements or medications in conjunction with IV infusions?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can. Speak with a provider.</p>
