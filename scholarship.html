        <h2>Some Tips Before You Come In:</h2>
			<ul>
                <li><b>Come Hydrated</b> so we can find a vein easily.</li>
                <li><b>But Don't be Too Hydrated...</b> you'll be sitting for 30min - 2hrs depending on the infusion... And since we are using a saline bag to infuse your treatment, we are hydrating you further, and... It gets a little complicated to go to the bathroom. So make sure you go beforehand, and probably don't plan on sipping on anything while getting your infusion.</li>
                <li><b>What to do With That Time?</b> Again, you'll be sitting for 30min-2hrs. So you might want to bring a book, or earbuds for your phone, or a laptop and work while you sit there. Of course, you could bring a friend and use the time to catch up!</li>
                <li><b>You Might Be Cold.</b> Even when we allow your ingredients to warm to room temperature before you arrive, that is still cooler than your internal body temperature. So an IV is likely to make you a little cold. We usually have clean blankets, but you may want to bring a sweater or blanket, just in case.</li>
            </ul>

		<h3>Ozone UBI</h3>
        <p>Ozone (O3) is added into your own 60 mL of blood and reinfused with the aid of ultraviolet light to promote optimal oxygenation, reduce inflammation, and modulate the immune response.</p>

            <li>Promotes optimal oxygenation</li>
            <li>Reduces inflammation</li>

		<h3>NAD+</h3>
        <p>NAD+ (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) occurs naturally in the body, and plays a major role in maximizing energy at the mitochondrial level, where micronutrients are converted to energy-rich ATP molecules to enable cellular function. NAD promotes fat metabolism and may help manage a wide spectrum of diseases, ranging from diabetes to cancer. It is neuro-regenerative & anti-aging.</p>

		<h3>Chelation</h3>
         <p>EDTA has been shown to remove lead, heavy metals, and aid in vascular flow, helping to reverse plaque formation. When starting treatment, patients need a mini-set at minimum, then may receive a single treatment every 1-3 months for maintenance.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 30px">Frequently Asked Questions:</h2>
        
		<h3 style="margin-bottom: -30px">How much does an IV infusion cost?</h3>
		<p>Because this is vitamins and nutrients, not medication, don't expect insurance to pay for treatment.</p>
        <p>See our <a href="/pdf/ivmenu.pdf" target="_blank">full menu</a> for pricing.</p>
        
        <h3 style="margin-bottom: -30px;margin-top: 20px">Does it hurt?</h3>
		<p> Just like getting your blood drawn, there will be a small stick. But once the IV is flowing, the needle is removed, and you just have a small piece of plastic as a conduit to your vein.
		</p>
        <p>You may be slightly cold, so come mentally prepared for that.</p>
        
        <h3 style="margin-bottom: -30px">How quickly will I see results?</h3>
		<p>It depends - on you and the treatment you receive. People coming in to treat inflammation or illness often feel better immediately. But for chronic issues, repeated treatments are recommended before expecting to see results.
        </p>
        
        <h3 style="margin-bottom: -30px">Who can receive IV infusions?</h3>
		<p>Almost anyone. You will need to consult with a provider beforehand to determine the best treatment option for you.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-bottom: -30px">Can I take other supplements or medications in conjunction with IV infusions?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can. Speak with a provider.</p>
