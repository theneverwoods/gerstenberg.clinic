        <h3 style="margin-bottom: -30px;margin-top: 20px">Does it hurt?</h3>
		<p> Just like getting your blood drawn, there will be a small stick. But once the IV is flowing, the needle is removed, and you just have a small piece of plastic as a conduit to your vein.
		</p>
        <p>You may be slightly cold, so come mentally prepared for that.</p>
        
        <h3 style="margin-bottom: -30px">How quickly will I see results?</h3>
		<p>It depends - on you and the treatment you receive. People coming in to treat inflammation or illness often feel better immediately. But for chronic issues, repeated treatments are recommended before expecting to see results.
        </p>
        
        <h3 style="margin-bottom: -30px">Who can receive IV infusions?</h3>
		<p>Almost anyone. You will need to consult with a provider beforehand to determine the best treatment option for you.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-bottom: -30px">Can I take other supplements or medications in conjunction with IV infusions?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can. Sp
