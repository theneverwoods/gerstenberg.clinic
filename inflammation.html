        <h2>How Can I Stop the Inflammation in My Body?</h2>
  
        <p>There are many, many contributors to inflammation. In general, the principle is: Give the body what it was intended to have, in optimal quantities, and let it do its thing. Do NOT put in/on the body what was not designed to have. Also, EVERYTHING you put in/on your body affects you, either in a positive or negative way....especially in terms of inflammation. Medical intervention is only a portion of the plan. If you commit to wellness, we WILL see the results you are looking for.</p>

    <h2>Pain = Inflammation</h2>
    <p>Any illness, whether acute or chronic, entails inflammation. <br/>Removing inflammation enhances the body's ability to do what it was designed to do.</p>

        <h2>Anti-Inflammatory Recommendations</h2>

        <h3>Avoidance</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Stop/avoid all tobacco/vaping products</li>
            <li>Reduce stress and optimize sleep (controls cortisol and the fight or flight response)</li>
            <li>Consider removing any amalgams/metals, piercings, or implants to the extent possible</li>
            <li>Limit excessive electromagnetic (EMF) radiation exposure (see p. 98 of Forty Something Forever book by Arline & Harold Brecher)</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Take Action</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Drink clean water (ideally RO/carbon- and chlorine/fluoride filtered, preferably alkalinized)</li>
            <li>Eat an optimal protein diet 1 gm/kg lean body weight; Low carb intake (near keto or keto, 10-30 gm net carbs 3x/day), with an organic, non-GMO, 80% plant based diet. Eat this way 90+% of the time or more. No cheats, or the body’s response will take days/week to recover gained ground.</li>
            <li>Move/exercise by aerobics and strength training</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Take Supplements</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Basics for all patients: probiotics, organic multivitamin, vitamins C & D.</li>
            <li>May also need omega-3 oil 1-4 grams/day.</li>
            <li>Others as specifically needed, such as binders (i.e. oral chelation, zeolites, or prescription med)</li>
        </ol>
