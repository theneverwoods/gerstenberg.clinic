        <h2>How Can I Stop the Inflammation in My Body?</h2>
        <h3>Anti-Inflammatory Recommendations</h3>
        <h2>IV Treatment Highlights:</h2>
        <p>There are many, many contributors to inflammation. In general, the principle is: Give the body what it was intended to have, in optimal quantities, and let it do its thing. Do NOT put in/on the body what was not designed to have. Also, EVERYTHING you put in/on your body affects you, either in a positive or negative way....especially in terms of inflammation. Medical intervention is only a portion of the plan. If you commit to wellness, we WILL see the results you are looking for.
