                <p>All patients should be on daily Vitamin C 500 mg, Vitamin E 400 IU and at least 81 mg of aspirin, unless there are compelling reasons to NOT take them, like an allergic reaction to one of them. Recent trials have also discovered that one's risk of a heart attack or stroke may be reduced up 40% by taking a 'statin' drug, like Lipitor, Crestor or Pravachol.</p>

              <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="diabetes">
                <h2 class="center no-m-t">Diabetes</h2>
                <p>All diabetics should adhere to the supplement recommendations listed above for hypertensive patients, and can derive the same benefits from 'statin' drugs as hypertensive patients. In addition, they should be on an ACE inhibitor [examples are Altace, Zestril, Aceon, Monopril or Lotensin) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) [examples are Diovan, Micardis or Benicar] to protect one's kidney function longterm. The nutrient chromium, taken in trace amounts (100-200 mcg/day), can help in glucose metabolism. Consult your personal physician for assistance in optimizing your diabetes management or visit the American Diabetes Association for the lastest diabetes news.</p>

              <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="cholesterol">
                <h2 class="center no-m-t">High Cholesterol</h2>
                <p>High Cholesterol affects nearly 1 in 4 Americans. The new goals lower the ideal LDL (bad cholesterol) to under 100. Many individuals would benefit from omega-3 fatty acids, like fish or flax oil supplementation. Optimizing one's weight and aerobic fitness helps, as well. Prescription medication is definitely reserved as a last resort to reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke.</p>

                <h5 class="center bold gray">(e.g., lupus, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic fatigue)</h5>
                <p>Many, many people suffer from an auto - immune disease and could be helped by a comprehensive evaluation and plan to conquer that which has come to dominate their lives. "I'LL DO ANYTHING TO HELP!" we often hear. Now there is something you can really do! Ask one of our physicans about this. Also, consider L.E.A.P. testing to see if your favorite foods may actually be harming you.</p>

                <p>Many have discovered that medication helps. They do chemically restrain, as they are designed to do. Wouldn't it be a "miracle" to see that change without medications. L.E.A.P. testing can give some science to the old adage "If you would stop giving your child wheat or red food coloring, s/he would be able to focus." A very structured home program is a must for these individuals, which must include both positive and negative reinforcements. Typically, it is the parents who need to be more consistent with performance expectations.</p>

              <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="vaccination">
                <h2 class="center no-m-t">Vaccination Education</h2>
                <p>Many parents have begun to ask a crucial question regarding childhood immunizations: "Why should or shouldn't my child(ren) get vaccinations?"  My suggestion is simply two-fold.  1) Don't do anything "just because we are told to do it."  I.e. be the parent!  You decide what your child(ren) need(s), based on their risk and based on their particular situation.  And 2) Don't do anything based on FEAR.  Don't let ANYone, including myself, scare you into any particular plan of action.</p>

                <h2 class="center no-m-t">Natural Options</h2>
                <p>There are a myriad of alternative medicine suggestions for care. You may consider one of these for minor illnesses, prior to going to see a health care provider:</p>
                <p>
                  Insect bites - put bentonite clay on the bites hourly, letting it dry on the skin<br>
                  Sunscreen/UV protection - coconut oil applied hourly during exposure, or try Sierra Madre Suncream from <a href="//supersouth.com">supersouth.com</a><br>
                  Cough suppressant - Elderberry syrup or Old Indian wild cherry bark syrup<br>
                  Sort throat - use natural clover honey, local bee honey or Throat Coat<br>
                  Insomina - try Natrol melatonin sublingual drops or make a tea with california poppy (may buy from Mountain Rose Herbs)<br>
                  Dry skin or eczema - use natural lanolin or kukui oil from Dr. Adorable<br>
                  Flu-like symptoms - vitamin c based on the person's weight 3-4 times daily AND vitamin D 5,000 - 10,000 IU 1-2 times daily AND filtered water 1/2 ounce/lb body weight daily, spread through the day
                </p>
