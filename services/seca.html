		<p>A high body fat percentage is a valuable indicator of your fitness as well as your risk for future complications such as diabetes, hypertension, and multiple cardiac conditions.<br>
		In contrast, BMI only takes into account your height and weight. It doesn’t provide any indication of your body fat content whatsoever, making Body Fat Percentage a more accurate health indicator than BMI.</p>

		<h3>This is more than a scale.</h3>
		<p>When you step on a scale and see that you’ve lost 3 pounds, what did you really lose? Fat? Muscle? Water? Some of each? Measuring your body composition allows you to truly understand the changes in your weight, and the changes in your body even when your weight remains the same.</p>
		<p>Body composition, or fat vs. fat-free (lean) mass, has long been considered one of the best determinants of disease prediction and a person’s overall health. It reflects the results of your physical activity and nutritional practices. Solely using body weight can be misleading because a scale can’t tell the difference between a pound of fat and a pound of muscle.</p>
		<p>Our non-invasive assessment is a medical-grade body composition analyzer that provides an in-depth evaluation more accurate than a bone density test. It measures fat mass, fat-free mass, total body water, intracellular water, extracellular water, and skeletal muscle mass in a rapid 17 seconds and prints out a detailed report. This is something a bathroom scale cannot do.</p>
		<p>With the seca mBCA, see the whole picture of what’s really going on in your body so you can track progress and make changes for better nutrition, exercise and health &amp; wellness.</p>
