		<p>The form and function of your penis can have a dramatic effect on your relationships. Being unable to achieve or maintain a satisfactory erection or even feeling that the size of your penis is inadequate can affect your self-esteem in and out of the bedroom.
		</p>
		<p>In the past, men had very few options for treating erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation or addressing penis girth. These issues are very private, personal and sometimes might feel embarrassing. It is quite normal to be a bit uncomfortable talking to your doctor about sexual dysfunction. Today, advanced technology allows expert physicians to offer men solutions for a variety of sexual issues.
        </p>   
        <p>The <b>Priapus Shot®</b> is designed to deliver lasting improvements in sexual performance for men, especially in those who experience the following symptoms:</p>
			<ul>
                <li>Decreased sensation</li>
                <li>Inability to achieve firmness during relations</li>
                <li>Difficulty maintaining firmness until you or your partner is satisfied</li>
                <li>Decrease in size (common with aging)</li>
                <li>Angled or bent shaft, or inability to penetrate (as in Peyronie’s Disease)</li>
                <li>Family relations impaired because of any of the above</li>
            </ul>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 60px">Frequently Asked Questions:</h2>
		<h3 class="bottom">How much does the P-Shot® cost?<h3>
		<p>$1800 cash - this is not covered by any insurance. We know this will help and satisfaction is guaranteed. If you are dissatisfied with your results, we will refund you 100%.</p>
		<h3 class="bottom">Does it hurt?</h3>
		<p>There is no pain or only mild discomfort during this procedure. We have each patient apply a very effective topical numbing cream.  Most men say they feel pressure, but not ‘pain.’
		</p>
        <h3 class="bottom">How much downtime is there after the Priapus Shot® Procedure?</h3>
		<p>None.  There are no use or activity restrictions after the P-Shot®.
        </p>
        <h3 class="bottom">Who can get the Priapus Shot® Procedure?</h3>
		<p>Almost any man.  You and your doctor will determine if this is right for you.  In some cases, more severe erectile dysfunction may need additional treatment. The P-Shot® is the base of most types of care. Men both on and off of testosterone therapy, those with diabetes, old and young may benefit from the P-Shot®.  </p>
        <h3 class="bottom">Will I need to take meds like Viagra® or Cialis® still?</h3>
        <p>This procedure is likely to lessen the need for erectile medication, perhaps even eliminate it.  Smokers consistently get less than ideal results.</p>
        <h3 class="bottom">Will the Priapus Shot® improve the size of my penis?</h3>
        <p>The P-Shot® helps with this, but does require you to pump in a very specific way, with the correct type of device.  Discuss with you doctor any questions regarding size enhancements.</p> 
        <h3 class="bottom">Can this help with Peyronie’s Disease?</h3>
        <p>The Priapus Shot® protocol for Peyronie’s disease uses scientifically proven procedures to reduce inflammation, increase circulation and aids in remodeling the penile tissue (often dramatically) toward a normal form and function.  Each situation is unique and a program will be tailored individually.</p>
