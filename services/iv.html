        <h3>Some Tips Before You Come In:</h3>
			<ul>
                <li><b>Be Hydrated so we can find a vein easily.</b></li>
                <li><b>But Don't be Too Hydrated...</b> you'll be sitting for 30min - 2hrs depending on the infusion... And since we are using a saline bag to infuse your treatment, we are hydrating you further... It gets a little complicated to go to the bathroom. So make sure you go beforehand, and probably don't plan on sipping on aything while you wait for your infusion to finish.</li>
                <li><b>What to do With That Time?</b> Again, you'll be sitting for 30min-2hrs. So you might want to bring a book, or earbuds for your phone... or a laptop like Sarah and work while you sit there.</li>
                <li><b>You Might Be Cold.</b> Even when we allow your ingredients to warm to room temperature before you arrive, that is still cooler than your internal body temperature. So an IV is likely to make you a little cold. We usually have clean blankets, but you may want to bring a sweater or blanket, just in case.</li>
            </ul>  
        <h3>What is the Cost?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Because this is vitamins and nutrients, not medication, don't expect insurance to pay for treatment. However, some insurances will pay for the saline or lactated ringers.</li>
                <li>See our <a href="/pdf/ivmenu.pdf">full menu</a> for pricing.</li>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 60px">Frequently Asked Questions:</h2>
		<h3 class="bottom">How much does the P-Shot® cost?<h3>
		<p>$1800 cash - this is not covered by any insurance. We know this will help and satisfaction is guaranteed. If you are dissatisfied with your results, we will refund you 100%.</p>
		<h3 class="bottom">Does it hurt?</h3>
		<p>There is no pain or only mild discomfort during this procedure. We have each patient apply a very effective topical numbing cream.  Most men say they feel pressure, but not ‘pain.’
		</p>
        <h3 class="bottom">How much downtime is there after the Priapus Shot® Procedure?</h3>
		<p>None.  There are no use or activity restrictions after the P-Shot®.
        </p>
        <h3 class="bottom">Who can get the Priapus Shot® Procedure?</h3>
		<p>Almost any man.  You and your doctor will determine if this is right for you.  In some cases, more severe erectile dysfunction may need additional treatment. The P-Shot® is the base of most types of care. Men both on and off of testosterone therapy, those with diabetes, old and young may benefit from the P-Shot®.  </p>
        <h3 class="bottom">Will I need to take meds like Viagra® or Cialis® still?</h3>
        <p>This procedure is likely to lessen the need for erectile medication, perhaps even eliminate it.  Smokers consistently get less than ideal results.</p>
        <h3 class="bottom">Will the Priapus Shot® improve the size of my penis?</h3>
        <p>The P-Shot® helps with this, but does require you to pump in a very specific way, with the correct type of device.  Discuss with you doctor any questions regarding size enhancements.</p> 
        <h3 class="bottom">Can this help with Peyronie’s Disease?</h3>
        <p>The Priapus Shot® protocol for Peyronie’s disease uses scientifically proven procedures to reduce inflammation, increase circulation and aids in remodeling the penile tissue (often dramatically) toward a normal form and function.  Each situation is unique and a program will be tailored individually.</p>
