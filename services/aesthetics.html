      <ul>
        <li>Skincolor has become grayer because of less blood flow.</li>
        <li>Fine vertical lines around the mouth.</li>
        <li>Scars from acne, trauma, or chicken pox.</li>
        <li>Skin texture has become less smooth.</li>

    <p> Collagen is a protein in your body that plays a vital role in the firmness and elasticity of your skin. As we age, collagen production starts to decrease. As a result, you may see fine lines and wrinkles, skin texture become less smooth (making us look tired), and skin color becomes more gray due to decreased blood flow. The Vampire Facial® offers a natural solution to skin rejuvenation.</p>

    <h3>How does the Vampire Facial® work?</h3>
    <p>The Vampire Facial® uses PRP in combination with Microneedling. Platelet Rich Plasma, or PRP, is isolated from the patient’s own blood using a centrifuge. Activation of the PRP results in release of at least 8 different growth factors that would normally be used to heal injured tissue. These growth factors work like magic go increase collagen and elastin, promote angiogenesis (or the formation of new blood vessels) and improve blood flow. Microneedling uses a tool with 36 tiny needles to create micro-punctures in your skin. Your body treats this micro-injury by sending fibroblasts to create more collagen in the affected area. The result is to naturally stimulate the production of collagen with minimal epidermal damage or trauma. Disposable one-time needle cartridges mean no risk for cross-contamination and patient safety.

    <h3>Step 1: Consultation</h3>
    <p>The medical professionals at gerstenberg.clinic will perform an extensive consultation to determine the best course of treatment for you. You will be counseled extensively on the Vampire Facial and given instructions on how to prepare for your upcoming procedure.</p>

  <div class="third card light">
    <h3>Step 2: PRP Preparation</h3>
    <p>First, your blood will be drawn. Using a centrifuge, the blood will be spun to isolate platelets (also known as platelet rich plasma, or PRP). This portion takes approximately 15 minutes in the office</p>

  <div class="third card light">
    <h3>Step 3: Prep the Skin for PRP</h3>
    <p>After numbing cream is applied, your face is treated by one of our medical providers with the micro-needling/Collagen P.I.N. device. This device creates gently small micro channels in your skin. The micro-needling device stimulates the creation of new skin cells, collagen formulation and regeneration of damaged cells.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="third card light">
    <h3>Step 4: PRP Massage</h3>
    <p>Your own PRP is then massaged into the skin. These growth factors then activate multi-potent stem cells already in the skin, tricking them into “thinking” there’s been an injury and new, younger tissue is generated.</p>
