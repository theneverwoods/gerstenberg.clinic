      <p>Semaglutide has swept the medical industry as a game changer in weight management. Originally, the incretin mimetic class was introduced in 2006 as a weight-loss option for diabetics.

      <p>Since then, the use of semaglutide in weight management has overwhelmed the nation in commercial prescription format. Since becoming available to compound pharmacies, sustained weight loss is <b>even more affordable for a fraction of the cost.</b></p>
