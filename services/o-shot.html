		<h3>50% of women complain of loss of vaginal sensation.
        <br>77% of women experience low sexual desire.</h3>
		<p>The O-Shot® procedure is a quick, twenty minute non-surgical procedure. It begins with a simple blood draw. Then, using a proprietary technique, platelet rich plasma is extracted from your own blood. PRP (platelet-rich plasma) is filled with growth factors. 
		</p>
		<p>When injected, PRP releases these growth factors which activate and regenerate the unipotent stem cells located in vaginal and clitoral tissues. This causes tissues to grow and repair, healing the area. This improves functional potential and enhances sexual response.
        </p>
		<p>Before it is injected, the area is completely numbed so that the procedure is painless. There is no recovery time and results are almost immediate in some women. However, since each woman is unique, your results may vary.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 30px">Frequently Asked Questions:</h2>
		<h3 class="bottom">Who can get the  O-Shot®?</h3>
		<p>Just about anyone can get an O-Shot®. Your doctor will help you determine if this procedure is for you.  Women both on and off hormone replacement therapy typically benefit from the O-Shot® procedure.
		</p>
        <h3 class="bottom">What is PRP or platelet rich plasma?</h3>
		<p>Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) uses the healing and growth factors from your own blood to stimulate stem cell activity that results in new tissue and blood vessel growth when injected in the area of need.
        </p>
        <h3 class="bottom">Does the O-Shot® procedure hurt?</h3>
		<p>A feew feel very minor discomfort. Your doctor will not hurt you. Most ladies feel nothing at all as this is our goal. At the most, ladies may feel a slight pinch or warm sensation.</p>
        <h3 class="bottom">Are there any side effects?</h3>
        <p>You may experience mild redness, swelling and/or numbness for a couple days.</p>
        <h3>What else should I expect to notice?</h3>
        <p>Some women have heightened arousal right away while others take several weeks for tissue regeneration and any prior dryness to diminish as lubrication improves. Orgasms usually intensify by 2-4 weeks but full effect occurs typically by 3 months.</p>        
        <h3 class="bottom">How long does the O-Shot® last?</h3>
        <p>Depending on the starting point, some women benefit from repeating the O-Shot® procedure again after 3 months, because they need further improvement. Once fully satisfied, many choose to do this every 1 to 3 years to stave off the tendency to declining health as we age. However, on average, women repeat the procedure every 18 months.</p> 
        <h3 class="bottom">Does the O-Shot® help lichen sclerosis?</h3>
        <p>In a recent study, researchers showed that women suffering with a skin thickening disorder called lichen sclerosis improved with the O-Shot® procedure. Women reported statistically significant improvement in symptoms and pathologists observed a decrease in inflammation.</p>  
        <h3 class="bottom">Are there restrictions after I have the O-Shot?</h3>
        <p>There are no restrictions at all. You may go about your day (and night) as usual, immediately after the procedure.</p>
