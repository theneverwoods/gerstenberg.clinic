		<h2>E.D. can be caused by many things</h2>
		<h3>But poor blood flow is the common denominator</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Diminished capacity of existing blood vessels</li>
			<li>Inability to trap blood</li>
			<li>Plaque buildup in penile arteries causing poor blood flow</li>
			<li>Neuropathy; loss of feeling to light touch</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The majority of all E.D. cases are attributed to diminished blood flow. The penis requires healthy blood flow to become completely erect, and even a slight reduction in blood flow can result in the inability to achieve or sustain an erection.</p>
		<h3>Other treatment options:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Oral medications</li>
			<li>Penile injections</li>
			<li>Surgical implants</li>
			<li>Penis pumps</li>
		</ul>
		<p>These options are less than optimal since they do not treat the underlying cause - poor blood flow.</p>

		<h3>What actually works.</h3>
		<p><b>Acoustic Wave Therapy</b> gets to the root of the problem by stimulating the body to heal itself, handling E.D. on a cellular level to create natural erections.</p>
		<p>Treatment is performed using a device that uses acoustic sound waves (a.k.a. low-intensity ESWT). This addresses the cause and not the symptoms by breaking up plaque and blockages and increasing blood flow by creating new blood vessels.</p>
		<p>Thus, the primary causes of vasculogenic E.D. are addressed by the body’s natural healing agents, so there are absolutely no side effects.<br>E.D. patients have a solution without the use of drugs, surgery, injections, or accessories.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Long-term results</li>
			<li>Spontaneity</li>
			<li>Non-invasive</li>
			<li>Over 85% effective</li>
			<li>Helps 70% of non-responders to PDE5i</li>
			<li>No risks or side effects</li>
			<li>Natural and safe</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>A well-researched therapy.</h3>
		<p>There are literally hundreds of articles published regarding using sound waves (a.k.a. pressure waves) for the treatment of men’s erectile dysfunction (E.D.). A current review article is found in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27986492" target="_blank">Journal of Sexual Medicine</a> in 2017. Herein, the authors offer a thorough review of low intensity therapy “Li-ESWT” for E.D.</p>

		<h3>Treatment breakdown:</h3>
		<p>Treatment is performed in the office by Dr. Gerstenberg without the need for anesthesia. A thorough medical consultation is needed to qualify you, then treatment typically is twice weekly for 6 sessions. For more severe cases, additional therapy or measures may be needed.</p>

		<h2>Think you qualify?</h2>
		<p>Have you done poorly on E.D. pills?</p>
		<p>Have you recently (in the last few years) lost the ability to achieve meaningful sexual performance?</p>
		<p>Do you have multiple medical conditions that have affected you?</p>
		<p>Are you willing to try effective, new therapy and can afford to pay out-of-pocket? Insurance doesn’t cover this treatment.</p>
