		<h2>E.D. can be caused by many things</h2>
		<h3>But poor blood flow is the common denominator</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Diminished capacity of existing blood vessels</li>
			<li>Inability to trap blood</li>
			<li>Plaque buildup in penile arteries causing poor blood flow</li>
			<li>Neuropathy; loss of feeling to light touch</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The majority of all E.D. cases are attributed to diminished blood flow. The penis requires healthy blood flow to become completely erect, and even a slight reduction in blood flow can result in the inability to achieve or sustain an erection.</p>
		<h3>Other treatment options:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Oral medications</li>
			<li>Penile injections</li>
			<li>Surgical implants</li>
			<li>Penis pumps</li>
		</ul>
		<p>These options are less than optimal since they do not treat the underlying cause - poor blood flow.</p>
