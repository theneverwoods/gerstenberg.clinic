The NeuralScan is also able to identify mild cognitive impairment and memory loss sooner than other methods, and is able to perform differential diagnosis of depression vs. dementia, and ADD vs. ADHD. It is bassically a lab test for the brain."

		<h3>Going to the root cause</h3>
		<p>As your most important organ, your brain serves as the center of your nervous system, controlling all parts of your body. Understanding and maintaining your brain function is important, especially when trying to manage these above issues.
		</p>
		<p>Since separate regions in your brain work together to produce all thoughts and body functions, each region can be measured and tested separately to determine if it is functioning optimally.</p>
		<p>The BrainView NeuralScan system is also able to identify mild cognitive impairment and memory loss sooner than other methods, and is able to perform differential diagnosis of depression vs. dementia, and ADD vs. ADHD.</p>
		<!-- FOLLOWING ONLY APPLIES TO EVOKE:
		<h3> Exercise your brain with eVoke</h3>
		<p>If you are dealing with symptoms of stress-related conditions like memory problems, cognitive impairment, or chronic pain, NeuralScan can also help <b>treat</b> symptoms through biofeedback. Biofeedback with NeuralScan is simple, painless, non-invsasive, does not require drugs, and can create long-lasting results. </p>
		<p>The results from your eVoke can help your doctor fine-tune and individualize your biofeedback training.</p>
		<p>By becoming consciously aware of what is going on inside your body, you can gain more control over your physical, mental, and emotional health. The BrainView NeuralScan system can help you train your heart and brain to achieve optimal function.</p>

		<h2>Ready to get tested?</h2>
		<h3>How it works:</h3>
		<p>The BrainView NeuralScan system runs a simple and painless assessment that takes about 45 minutes. During the test, you’ll wear the EEG cap, similar to a swim cap. The BrainView NeuralScan system prompts you through a series of simple exercises while your brainwave activity is recorded.</p>
		<p>The resulting NeuralScan reveals objective measurements of your brain and heart function that help your doctor develop a care plan that is best for you. </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 30px">Frequently Asked Questions:</h2>
        <h3>Why should I consider doing BrainView testing?</h3>
        <p>BrainView shows markers that relate to working memory, sensory/processing concerns, and focus. It can help discriminate ADD from ADHD, or ADD/ADHD from anxiety or similar states. Patients wondering about memory impairment, like early dementia or concerns for Alzheimer's disease can be tested.</p>
		<h3 class="bottom">Who can get BrainView NeuralScan testing?</h3>
        <p>BrainView is for all ages. If a child is able to read and sit still and answer questions on a screen, they most likely can take this test.</p>
        <h3 class="bottom">How much does the BrainView NeuralScan cost?</h3>
		<p>As of 2024, most insurances are not covering the BrainView NeuralScan test. Therefore, we will be collecting the cost up front of $299.</p>
        <h3>What can you expect during BrainView NeuralScan testing?</h3>
        <p>Testing is easy to get done. Our team will fit a testing cap onto your head (your hair will have water-based gel from testing in it afterwards). You will sit in a dark, quiet room while the EEG electrodes track your brain waves. Initially the test is very quiet, while it measures background brain activity, then it plays sounds or changes images on the computer screen, measuring brain activity. Last, you will have a button to quickly indicate as soon as you notice the right image being shown on the screen.</p>
        <h3>How do I prepare for the test?</h3>
        <p>Do NOT drink energy drinks, more than two cups of coffee, or take any stimulant medications within 12 hours prior to testing. This includes weight loss medications like phentermine, or any stimulant ADD/ADHD medications, such as Adderall® or Focalin®.</p>
