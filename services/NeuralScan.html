description: "The BrainView NeuralScan system quantitatively assesses and often distinguishes various cognitive problems. The NeuralScan is also able to identify mild cognitive impairment and memory loss sooner than other methods, and is able to perform differential diagnosis of depression vs. dementia, and ADD vs. ADHD. It is bassically a lab test for the brain."

		<h3>Going to the root cause</h3>
		<p>As your most important organ, your brain serves as the center of your nervous system, controlling all parts of your body. Understanding and maintaining your brain function is important, especially when trying to manage these above issues.
		</p>
		<p>Since separate regions in your brain work together to produce all thoughts and body functions, each region can be measured and tested separately to determine if it is functioning optimally.</p>
		<p>The BrainView NeuralScan system is also able to identify mild cognitive impairment and memory loss sooner than other methods, and is able to perform differential diagnosis of depression vs. dementia, and ADD vs. ADHD.</p>
		<!-- FOLLOWING ONLY APPLIES TO EVOKE:
		<h3> Exercise your brain with eVoke</h3>
		<p>If you are dealing with symptoms of stress-related conditions like memory problems, cognitive impairment, or chronic pain, NeuralScan can also help <b>treat</b> symptoms through biofeedback. Biofeedback with NeuralScan is simple, painless, non-invsasive, does not require drugs, and can create long-lasting results. </p>
		<p>The results from your eVoke can help your doctor fine-tune and individualize your biofeedback training.</p>
		<p>By becoming consciously aware of what is going on inside your body, you can gain more control over your physical, mental, and emotional health. The BrainView NeuralScan system can help you train your heart and brain to achieve optimal function.</p>

		<h2>Ready to get tested?</h2>
		<h3>How it works:</h3>
		<p>The BrainView NeuralScan system runs a simple and painless assessment that takes about 45 minutes. During the test, you’ll wear the EEG cap, similar to a swim cap. The BrainView NeuralScan system prompts you through a series of simple exercises while your brainwave activity is recorded.</p>
		<p>The resulting NeuralScan reveals objective measurements of your brain and heart function that help your doctor develop a care plan that is best for you. </p>
